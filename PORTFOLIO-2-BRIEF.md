# Portfolio 2
### Goal
As you are nearing the end of your studies and getting closer to becoming a front-end developer, you should take some time to reflect on work you've done previously. Looking back over past projects allows you to revise and improve on work we've done based on the new skills you've learned.

### Brief
In this assignment, you are going to select 3 compulsory assignments (CAs and projects) that you have previously submitted in second year. Note that the assignments must have been marked 'passed'. You're then going to work on making improvements to them, using the feedback received from your teachers and your own self-assessment. Take the skills you've learned and apply them to old assignments. You will then need to write a report covering your updates, and why you made them. Use clear reasoning of why and how you made the changes you did.

### Marking Criteria
* Can carry out work in web design and develop simple interactive web solutions
* Masters relevant report writing to present his/her own projects and products
* Can study his/her own performance through the year and identify the potential for improvement in deliveries and make appropriate changes

### Submission
* A zip folder of the updated assignments.
* A PDF report that focusses on what changes you've made to the three submissions and why you've made them. Please include references in your report and use the report template provided.
